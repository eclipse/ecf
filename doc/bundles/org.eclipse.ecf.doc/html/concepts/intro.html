	<h3>ECF Containers</h3>
       ECF introduces the concept of a communications <b>container</b>.  ECF containers represent access to 
       a protocol-specific communications context. For connection-oriented communications, an ECF container loosely 
       corresponds to the traditional notion of a communications <b>session</b>, but the more general container concept is also
       useful for capturing context even if the communications are non connection-oriented.
       <p></p>
       ECF containers can represent both point-to-point communications (e.g. client/server) or 
       publish-and-subscribe (group) communications.  Container instances can provide access to synchronous
       communications only, asynchronous communications only, or both together.  This flexibility allows
       many communications applications to be constructed out of one or more containers...each of which
       provides access to some specific communications context and some protocol for communicating within
       that context.
       <h3><a name="Instance Creation"></a>Instance Creation</h3>       
       Container instance creation is done via ECF-provided factory APIs.  For example, here's code to create 
       and IContainer instance:
       <pre>
       IContainer container = ContainerFactory.getDefault().createContainer("containertype");
       </pre>
       Once constructed, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/core/IContainer.html">IContainer</a> instances may be used in the manner appropriate for the given application.  When
       no longer required the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/core/IContainer.html#dispose()">IContainer.dispose()</a> method should be called to release any resources associated with
       the container instance upon construction.
       <h3><a name="Container Connection"></a>Container Connection/Disconnection</h3>
       The IContainer interface exposes two key methods:  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/core/IContainer.html#connect(org.eclipse.ecf.core.identity.ID,%20org.eclipse.ecf.core.security.IConnectContext)">connect(ID targetID, IConnectContect connectContext)</a> and disconnect().  
       As is obvious, these two methods allow
       container implementations to initiate communication with remote services, 
       either server-based or group-based communications.
       <p></p>
       Notice the first parameter to the connect method...<b>targetID</b>.  TargetID is of 
       type <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/core/identity/ID.html">ID</a>.  The <b>targetID</b> parameter 
       <b>identifies the target server or group</b> for the connect operation.  It is of type <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/core/identity/ID.html">ID</a> so that the
       to allow the target communications service to be of many kinds...e.g. client-server or peer-to-peer.  For example, for http communication the targetID would consist of
       the URL specifying a particular file at a particular path on a particular server...e.g: <b>http://www.eclipse.org/ecf</b>.  For some
       other communications protocol the ID provided would be different...e.g:  <b>sip:someone@example.com;transport=tcp</b>.  All such targets for
       connect may be represented via an instance of the ID interface.
       <h3><a name="Example Connection Code"></a>Example Container Creation and Connection Code</h3>
       Here's an example code snippet that shows the creation and connection of an ECF container:
       <pre>
       // make container instance
       IContainer cont = ContainerFactory.getDefault().createContainer("ecf.generic.client");
       // make targetID
       ID targetID = IDFactory.getDefault().createID(cont.getConnectNamespace(),"ecftcp://ecf1.osuosl.org:3282/server");
       // then connect to targetID
       cont.connect(targetID,null);
       </pre>       
       <h3><a name="Extensibility"></a>Container Extensibility through Adapters</h3>
       In order to support run-time extensibility, the IContainer interface inherits from org.eclipse.core.runtime.IAdaptable.  This 
       interface exposes the 'getAdapter(Class intf)' method.  In the case of IContainer instances,
       this allows clients to query the container at runtime about it's exposed interfaces, and get
       access to those interfaces if available.  So, for example, perhaps we're interested in creating an 
       instant messaging application and wish to use the capabilities exposed by the 
       <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.docs/api/org/eclipse/ecf/presence/IPresenceContainer.html">IPresenceContainer</a> interface.
       To do this, we simply query the IContainer instance at runtime to see if it provides access
       to IPresenceContainer capabilities:
       <pre>
       IPresenceContainer pc = (IPresenceContainer) cont.getAdapter(IPresenceContainer.class);
       if (pc != null) {
           // The container DOES exposed IPresenceContainer capabilities, so we can use them!
       } else {
           // The container does not expose IPresenceContainer capabilities...we're out of luck
       }
       </pre>
       Among other positive characteristics, this adapter mechanism provides a consistent-yet-simple way for
       a wide variety of container types to be defined and used without the need to update the ECF
       IContainer abstractions.
