The use of the TimeServiceHost.generic.etc.product relies on the presence of the 
org.eclipse.ecf.provider.etcd discovery provider.  This bundle is available 
here:  https://github.com/ECF/etcd-provider/tree/master/bundles/org.eclipse.ecf.provider.etcd

It also assumes that an etcd server is running on 127.0.0.1 at port 2379.  The system properties
in the product config are currently set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port 2379 via:

-Decf.discovery.etcd.hostname=127.0.0.1
-Decf.discovery.etcd.port=2379

These can be changed in the product config or the generated launch config if desired to
point at some other etcd server.
